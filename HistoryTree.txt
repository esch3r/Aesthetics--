What would a Tree Witness During its Lifetime? Sit Spot


As a tree, in my lifetime I have witnessed many of my family members dismembered. --That is to say, they were either decapitated or cut limb to limb. To me, humans live out short self centered lives that are isolated from the wilderness. They often forget what lies outdoors. Humans live in small cubicles they call “houses” meant for sustaining life.
